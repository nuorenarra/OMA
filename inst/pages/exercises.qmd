## Tips for exercises

- Add clear comments explaining each line or section of code. This enhances
understanding for both you and others, aids in debugging, facilitates code
reuse, and promotes transparency.
- Interpret results by comparing them to existing literature. Summarize key
findings to ensure they are easily understandable, even for those without
advanced expertise in data analytics.
- Avoid hard-coding values. Instead, define variables at the start of the
code chunk to make parameter adjustments easier and improve code reusability.
