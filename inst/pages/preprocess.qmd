As a first step after importing the data into `TreeSE`, one should explore
the data and perform quality control (QC). This is important because data
quality affects the final results, and failing to assess it accurately can
lead to erroneous interpretations. QC and exploration are discussed in
[@sec-quality-control].

Based on the QC results, researchers usually apply sample and feature
filtering to improve the robustness of the analysis. To focus on a
specific taxonomic rank, data agglomeration is commonly performed.
Filtering and agglomeration are discussed in detail in
[@sec-treese_subsetting] and [@sec-agglomeration].

Data transformations, covered in [@sec-assay-transform], are applied after
filtering. For more information on preprocessing, you can refer to
[@Zhou2023], for instance.
