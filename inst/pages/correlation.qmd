In correlation — or association analysis more generally — we can evaluate the
relationships between numeric variables. These variables can be taxonomic
features or patient metadata. For instance, we might be interested in which
taxonomic features are present simultaneously with others, or whether body
weight is associated with the abundance of certain features. In this chapter,
we will demonstrate how to perform correlation analysis with
`getCrossAssociation()` method.

## Association between taxonomic features

Here we demonstrate, how to analyse which bacteria co-exists in the dataset.

```{r}
#| label: association1

library(mia)

data("peerj13075")
tse <- peerj13075

# Agglomerate to certain taxonomy level
tse <- agglomerateByPrevalence(tse, rank = "class")

# Apply clr-transform and scale
tse <- transformAssay(tse, method = "clr", pseudocount = TRUE)
tse <- transformAssay(
    tse, assay.type = "clr", method = "standardize", MARGIN = "rows")

# Get correlation results
res <- getCrossAssociation(
    tse, tse, assay.type1 = "clr", assay.type2 = "clr",
    test.signif = TRUE, mode = "matrix")
```

We can visualize the result with heatmap as we do later in this chapter, or
we can visualize the results with correlation network plot as done below.

```{r}
#| label: association3

library(qgraph)

# Create correlation network plot
qgraph(
    res$cor, layout = "spring", labels = colnames(res$cor),
    label.cex = 1.2, theme = "colorblind",
    node.width = 1.5, node.height = 2)
```

You can find more on networks from [@sec-network-learning].

## Association between taxonomic features and sample metadata

Now, we can calculate alpha diversity indices, and evaluate if they have
significant association with taxonomic features.

```{r}
#| label: association4

# Calculate diversity measures
index <- c(
    "shannon", "log_modulo_skewness", "coverage", "inverse_simpson", "gini")
tse <- addAlpha(tse, index = index)

# Get correlation results
res <- getCrossAssociation(
    tse, tse, assay.type1 = "clr", col.var2 = index,
    test.signif = TRUE, mode = "matrix")
```

Below, we present the results using a heatmap visualization.

```{r}
#| label: association5
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 8

library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(shadowtext)

# Function for marking significant correlations with "X"
add_signif <- function(j, i, x, y, width, height, fill) {
    # If the p-value is under threshold
    if( !is.na(res$p_adj[i, j]) & res$p_adj[i, j] < 0.05 ){
        # Print "X"
        grid.shadowtext(
            sprintf("%s", "X"), x, y, gp = gpar(fontsize = 8, col = "#f5f5f5"))
    }
}

# Create a heatmap
p <- Heatmap(res$cor,
    # Print values to cells
    cell_fun = add_signif,
    heatmap_legend_param = list(
        title = "correlation", legend_height = unit(5, "cm")),
    column_names_rot = 45
    )
p
```

## Association between sample metadata variables {#sec-alpha-correlation}

Finally, we demonstrate how to calculate correlation between sample metadata
variables. Here we estimate correlation between alpha diversity measures.

Compared to the solution in [@sec-compare-alpha], `getCrossAssociation()`
allows us to calculate correlations in bulk easily, without the need for
looping.

```{r}
#| label: association6

# Get correlation results
res <- getCrossAssociation(
    tse, tse, col.var1 = index, col.var2 = index,
    test.signif = TRUE, mode = "matrix")

# Create a heatmap and store it
p <- Heatmap(res$cor,
    # Print values to cells
    cell_fun = add_signif,
    heatmap_legend_param = list(
        title = "correlation", legend_height = unit(5, "cm")),
    column_names_rot = 45
    )
p
```

## Exercises

**Goal:** After completing these exercises, you should be able to calculate
associations between taxonomic features and diversity.

**Exercise 1: Correlation**

1. Load any of the example datasets mentioned in [@sec-example-data].

2. Agglomerate data to phylum level.

3. Apply CLR transformation.

4. Calculate correlation of abundances of taxa.

5. Visualize the correlation network. Are there taxonomic features whose
abundances correlate?

6. Calculate all available alpha diversity indices with the un-agglomerated
data.

7. Calculate correlation between phyla and alpha diversity indices.

8. Visualize the correlation results with a heatmap. Are there taxonomic
features whose abundances associate with the diversity? How can you interpret
this?

Useful functions:

`data()`, `agglomerateByRank`, `transformAssay()`, `getCrossAssociation()`,
`qgraph::qgraph()`, `addAlpha()`, `ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap()`
