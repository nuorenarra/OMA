Multi-omics approaches integrate data from multiple sources. For
example, we can integrate taxonomic abundance profiles with
metabolomic or other biomolecular profiling data to observe
associations, make predictions, or aim at causal
inferences. Integrating evidence across multiple sources can lead to
enhanced predictions, more holistic understanding, or facilitate the
discovery of novel biomarkers.

In the following chapters, we explore common approaches for multi-assay data
integration. These methods can be broadly categorized into association-based
techniques, ordination models that leverage latent shared factors, and machine
learning models for classification and regression. For more details, see the
following chapters:
